# VoicenterWebSDK  
Voicenter API  Web-service SDK  including all what you need for IVR, Popup , Cdr2CRM and more.
### Running the project
For Running the server, run a script with the following logic :
```javascript
    const VoicenterWebSDK = require("voicenter-web-sdk");
    const vcSDK = new VoicenterWebSDK({host:'0.0.0.0',port:3000});
    vcSDK.start();
```
this will start a web service that will serve and interact with the different Web API's that Voicenter offers to its customers. more information can be found in:
[https://www.voicenter.co.il/API]
The final path of this service will be entered into the "mini-external-url" found in the layer settings tab.

### Testing
A call for a TestLogic Call logic controller will look like this:
http://127.0.0.1:3000/Ivr/TestLogic
### Reloading settings
and call with reload=true will  make the server reload the call logic without the need for a server restart. 
http://127.0.0.1:3000/Ivr/TestLogic?reload=true

### Example for a Call Logic
A simple Call Logic module should look the following example and should be located inside a TestLogic.js file in the root of the project:
```javascript
    module.exports = async function (call) {
	    call.SetParam("foo","Hello");
	    call.SetParam("foo",call.GetParam("foo")+" World");
	    if(call.CallerID==="0512345678"){
		    call.Say(111);
		   }else{
		    call.GoToLayer(22);
	     }
    }
```
### Call Logic parameters:
Call logic are function that the server is executing for each IVR call request.
the function will be getting the call object with the following parameters and functions:

**Parameter List:**

| Parameter name | description   | value for example   
|:--|--|:--|  
| Did | DID number that the call was received on (Incoming number).  |031234567 |  
| CallerID | Called ID is the number of the current caller calling the DID number | 0512345678 |  
| CallID | Voicenter unique ID of a call. Can be used for state purposes (also referred to as IVR_UNIQUE_ID) | 76f4hsd4li45m7ergrtg4562456yt |  
| DTMF | If the caller was requested to enter some digits over the phone - the input will be passed in this parameter. *In case the caller did not enter any value (did not make any dial action and timeout has been reached), the default value will always be “0”. | 2 |  
| LayerID | The current layer ID in the IVR that the request is sent from.  | 1 |  
| PreviousLayerID | If the call was passed to the layer from another layer, the previous layer will be shown here. | 0 |
